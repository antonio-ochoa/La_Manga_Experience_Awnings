            "The <strong>stor awning stands out for its aesthetic simplicity</strong>, quick installation, and easy manual operation. Designed especially for balconies and small terraces, this model is custom-made to make the most of your outdoor space with shade.",
            "Its aluminum arms, equipped with springs, fold discreetly against the load bar when not in use. When the awning is extended, the arms are fixed to the railing with a pin hook system, providing greater resistance and stability.",
            "Once fixed, the stor awning allows you to continue lowering the fabric to move the load bar outward. <strong>This facilitates the entry of light and ventilation</strong> and offers a clear view of the street."
